*A Web Application to Support Research in Predictive Monitoring Tasks*


Nirdizati Research is a tool that aims at supporting expert users in finding the best predictive models suitable for specific datasets and prediction problems. The predictive models can then be used to provide predictions at runtime on incomplete traces or streams of events.

The tool offers a wide selection of features ranging from event log preprocessing options to hyperparmeter optimization as well as runtime feedback to the user.
